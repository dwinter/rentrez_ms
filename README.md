# WIP on a manuscript for rentrez (at last!)

## Why isn't this fully reproducable

Unfortunately a [bug/issue with `pandoc`](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/2493)
combined with the [particular format of the R Journal style](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/49)
prents automated conversion from rmarkdown to LaTex.

Instead `witner.Rmd` can be converted to a html document with the same contents
as the main document (which I have produced by marking up the .md file produced
by this change.
